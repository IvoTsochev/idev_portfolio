  <p>Hi, my name is Ivaylo Tsochev a junior developer in the start.</p>
  <p>Now I'm 29 but I've always had a passion for computers (mostly games: E). At 26, I was interested in programming and, in particular, in C ++. I did not like the language ... Then I tried with Java, but I did not like it either. Eventually I started with Python, which is super interesting and very readable. I did not stop here, I wanted something to do - to be able to see it. I have already begun with Javascript!/p>
  <p>I'm currently studying Python at Softuny, and Bootstrap, CMLT5, CS, Javascript are studying them alone.</p>
  <p>For now what I can do is basically Python programs and plain web pages...</p>
  <p>At this time I dont have projects. This webpage is my project :)</p>
